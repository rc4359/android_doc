You can set your JAVA_HOME in /etc/profile as Petronilla Escarabajo suggests. But the preferred location for JAVA_HOME or any system variable is /etc/environment.

Open /etc/environment in any text editor like nano or gedit and add the following

JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/open-jdk" (java path could be different)

Use source to load the variables, by running this command:

source /etc/environment

Then check the variable, by running this command:

echo $JAVA_HOME
